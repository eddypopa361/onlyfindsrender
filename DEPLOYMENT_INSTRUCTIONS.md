# Deployment Instructions - Build Structure Fix

## Problem Solved
The deployment was failing because the build process created files in `dist/` but the deployment system expected them in `dist/public/`.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Build Process Enhancement
The build process now includes a post-build step that creates the correct directory structure:

```bash
# Standard build command (as used by deployment system)
npm run build

# Post-build structure creation
node ensure-build-structure.cjs
```

### 2. Required Files
- **ensure-build-structure.cjs** - Automatically creates the correct directory structure after build
- **build.sh** - Complete build script for manual builds (alternative)

### 3. Directory Structure Created
```
dist/
├── index.html          # Vite build output (root level)
├── assets/             # Vite build output (root level)  
├── index.js            # Backend server bundle
└── public/             # DEPLOYMENT-READY FILES
    ├── index.html      # ✅ Required by deployment
    ├── assets/         # ✅ All frontend assets
    ├── data/           # ✅ Static data files
    ├── images/         # ✅ Logo and images
    └── favicon.ico     # ✅ Site favicon

server/
└── public/             # Development static files
    └── [same structure as dist/public/]
```

## Deployment Commands

### For Automated Deployment (Replit)
The deployment system will run:
```bash
npm run build
```

Then run this command to fix the structure:
```bash
node ensure-build-structure.cjs
```

### For Manual Deployment
Use the comprehensive build script:
```bash
./build.sh
```

## Verification
After build, these files must exist:
- ✅ `dist/public/index.html` (frontend entry point)
- ✅ `dist/index.js` (backend server)
- ✅ `dist/public/assets/` (frontend assets)
- ✅ `dist/public/images/` (static images)
- ✅ `dist/public/data/` (static data)

## Status
✅ **Build structure fixed**
✅ **Deployment compatibility ensured**  
✅ **Both development and production environments supported**

The deployment should now work correctly!
