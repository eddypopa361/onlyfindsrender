What is ONLYFINDS?
ONLYFINDS does not sell products. We showcase curated public links from partner platforms so you can explore styles, compare options, and save time. Our focus is clarity, organization, and practical tips that help you shop smarter.

Our principles

Curation, not clutter: We highlight relevant finds and remove noise.

Transparency: Clear copy, clear links, no hidden steps.

Community value: User feedback helps others make informed choices.

Responsible shopping: Always follow local laws and platform rules.

Important: Nothing here is legal or financial advice. Please review your country’s regulations before ordering internationally. ONLYFINDS links to third-party platforms and is not responsible for third-party listings or services.

Your First Steps
1) Create your partner account
Register on CNFANS and look for welcome offers in your dashboard (often including a shipping coupon).

2) Explore categories on ONLYFINDS
Browse by theme (e.g., Trending Now, Latest Finds, Shoes, Accessories, Coats & Jackets, Hoodies & Pants, T-Shirt & Shorts, Electronic Products, Perfumes, Womans) to get a feel for styles, budgets, and what ships well.

3) Compare items thoughtfully
Look at photos, materials, construction details, and recent user impressions. If you’re new, start with a small order to calibrate expectations (fit, finish, shipping time).

4) Plan total cost
Consider product price, shipping, taxes/duties, and your preferred timeline. If you plan to buy multiple items, consolidation can help reduce the effective per-item shipping cost (results vary by line and destination).

Making Your First Purchase
Pre-purchase checklist

Confirm size and measurements.

Review recent feedback or community notes.

Ensure the purchase link is current.

Decide how you want items packed (e.g., lighter packaging to control volume/weight).

Order flow (high level)

Select item and options.

Review the shipping method that fits your budget and timeline.

Apply any available CNFANS coupon at checkout (check your dashboard first).

Place the order and track progress.

After your order arrives

Inspect stitching, hardware/finishes, and overall construction.

Compare color/fit with the listing photos.

Keep photos and order details in case you need support.

Understanding Quality & Materials
Quality varies by maker, material, and batch. Here’s what to look for:

Materials: Fabrics, leather alternatives, weight, lining.

Construction: Stitching consistency, zippers, buttons/hardware.

Finishing: Edges, seams, color accuracy, symmetry.

Tip: When you’re new, start small. Use early purchases to learn what matches your preferences.

Community & Support
Reviews help everyone: Share honest impressions (fit, build, color accuracy, shipping experience).

Respectful Q&A: Ask clear questions; respond to others with specifics.

Shipping questions: For courier/line issues, contact the partner platform’s support with screenshots and order IDs.

ONLYFINDS can’t change third-party orders, but we can point you to useful resources and encourage good documentation.

Smart Ways to Save
Welcome & seasonal offers: Look for dashboard coupons (e.g., CNFANS welcome offers) and seasonal promotions.

Consolidation: If you’re ordering multiple items, one outbound parcel often reduces total cost compared to several small ones.

Timing: Shipping lines can fluctuate around major holidays; plan ahead when possible.
