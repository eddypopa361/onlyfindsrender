Our Community Values
Core principles

Honesty & transparency: Share clear, experience-based information.

Respect: Treat other members—and sellers on partner platforms—fairly.

Responsibility: Shop thoughtfully; consider cost, quality, and impact.

Intellectual property awareness: Respect creators and follow local laws.

Education: Help others learn with practical, accurate guidance.

Legal & Ethical Framework (Plain Language)
ONLYFINDS does not sell products. We curate public links to third-party platforms.

Follow your local laws. Rules differ by country. Nothing here is legal advice.

Respect IP. Choose designer-inspired or fashion alternatives responsibly.

Be truthful. Never misrepresent an item’s origin or authenticity.

If you’re unsure about what’s allowed in your country, check official sources or seek professional advice before ordering internationally.

Communication Standards & Etiquette
Be constructive. Share real experiences; avoid personal attacks.

Separate taste from facts. “I prefer heavier fabric” ≠ “This is low quality.”

Resolve calmly. Try direct, respectful messages before public disputes.

Assume good intent. Ask clarifying questions; don’t jump to conclusions.

Information-Sharing Ethics
Accuracy first. Post only what you know or have verified.

Cite sources when relevant. Credit helpful posts or reviewers.

Respect privacy. Don’t share private messages, addresses, or personal data.

Keep info current. Update or correct posts if things change.

Working With Sellers on Partner Platforms
Professional tone. Be clear about sizing, materials, timelines, and budget.

Fair expectations. Understand that availability and timelines can vary.

Constructive feedback. If something’s off, explain calmly with photos.

Timely payment & follow-through. Keep interactions courteous and reliable.

If problems arise

Contact the seller with specifics (order ID, photos, dates).

Use the partner platform’s support/mediation if needed.

Post public reviews responsibly—factual, balanced, and updated if resolved.

Reviews, Recommendations & Educational Content
Helpful reviews include

Photos that reflect real color/finish.

Notes on stitching, hardware, fit, and comfort.

Sizing context (height/weight or usual size) to guide others.

A balanced view: what worked and what didn’t.

Guides & tutorials

Keep steps accurate and tested.

Flag risks or caveats.

Update if platforms or policies change.

Market talk

Avoid speculation. If you share trends, say what they’re based on (e.g., “recent listings,” “seasonal promos,” etc.).

Environmental & Social Responsibility
Quality over quantity. Buy what you’ll actually use.

Minimize waste. Request lighter packaging when possible; recycle.

Consolidate shipments when it makes sense to reduce total materials and trips.

Be mindful of impact. Consider how choices affect people and the planet.

New Member Support & Community Growth
Welcome newcomers. Share tips without gatekeeping.

Teach responsibly. Highlight rules, risks, and best practices.

Give constructive feedback on platform features and policies.

Lead by example. Set the tone you want to see.

Quality Signals to Look For (Practical, Non-technical)
Materials & construction: Fabric weight, stitching consistency, hardware feel.

Finishing: Seams, edges, symmetry, color accuracy.

Fit & comfort: Compare size charts with community feedback.

Consistency over time: Re-order experiences matter; share trends.

Conflict Resolution & Governance
Start private, then escalate. Many issues resolve with calm DMs.

Use platform channels. When needed, contact partner support with evidence.

Be fair in public. Include context, timelines, and any fixes offered.

Evolve together. Community standards improve as we learn—participate in updates.

Quick Checklist (Save/Share)
