How CNFANS shipping costs are calculated
Common drivers

Weight & size: Carriers consider actual or volumetric weight (whichever is higher). Reducing package volume can lower charges.

Destination: Rates vary by region and service availability.

Shipping line: Economy tends to be cheaper; priority economy balances speed and price; express is fastest and usually costs more.

Seasonality: Demand spikes around major shopping periods can influence prices and capacity.

Other fees to be aware of

Platform & service fees: Processing, handling, and optional services (e.g., extra photos, special packing) may add cost.

Storage: Warehousing beyond free windows can incur daily fees.

Insurance: Optional but useful for higher-value parcels.

Finding CNFANS coupons & promo opportunities (2025)
Welcome offers for new users: After sign-up, open Coupons/Promotions in your dashboard to see what’s available.

Seasonal promos: Big shopping periods (e.g., 11.11, 12.12, Black Friday/Cyber Monday) often bring stronger promotions with limited windows.

First shipments & events: Occasionally there are special discounts for early orders or time-boxed events.

How to apply: Choose your shipping line, then apply an eligible CNFANS discount code at checkout; confirm the price reflects the discount before paying.

Tip: Set a reminder for coupon expiry so you don’t miss the window.

Packaging & consolidation tips that usually save money
Consolidate when it makes sense: One outbound parcel often costs less than several smaller ones because you pay handling/linehaul once.

Reduce volume where available: Request lighter packaging options; avoid excess filler; group small accessories together.

Protect wisely: Use enough protection for delicate items without over-packing.

Quality check: Approve photo/video QC (when offered) before consolidation to reduce re-ship risk.

Choosing the right shipping line
Economy: Lower cost if your timeline is flexible.

Priority economy: Often a good balance of speed and price.

Express: Fastest option for time-sensitive items.
Compare ETA, tracking, and cost for your destination before paying.

Regional considerations
Popular routes may have more frequent departures and competitive pricing.

Remote destinations might benefit from careful planning (e.g., consolidate, compare lines, allow extra time).
Always verify available lines and estimates for your specific address at checkout.

Customs & import basics (compliance first)
Know your local rules: Duties/taxes, documentation, and thresholds are set by your country.

Declare accurately: Follow the law for item descriptions and values.

Consider professional help: For complex shipments, a licensed customs broker can advise on documentation and process.

Tracking, delivery & support
Track across platforms: Check both the partner dashboard and the carrier’s tracking page.

Enable notifications: Get alerts for key milestones.

Delivery readiness: Ensure address accuracy and that someone can receive the parcel.

If issues arise: Gather order IDs and screenshots, then contact customer support through official channels.
