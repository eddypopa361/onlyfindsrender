1) CNFANS Shipping Fundamentals
What drives cost

Weight & size: Carriers charge by actual or volumetric weight (whichever is higher). Reducing package volume usually lowers the total.

Destination: Rates, ETAs, and line availability vary by region.

Shipping line: Economy tends to be cheapest; priority economy balances speed and price; express is fastest and usually costs more.

Seasonality: Peak periods (major shopping events/holidays) can affect both price and capacity.

Other considerations

Platform & service fees: Handling, optional photo checks, special packing.

Storage: Exceeding free storage windows can add daily fees.

Insurance: Optional, useful for higher-value parcels.

2) Finding CNFANS Coupons & Shipping Deals
Welcome offers: After sign-up, open Coupons/Promotions in your dashboard for any CNFANS discount code available to new users.

Seasonal promos: Watch 11.11, 12.12, and year-end sales—CNFANS shipping deals often improve during these windows.

How to use CNFANS coupons: Choose your shipping line, apply an eligible code at checkout, and confirm the discount appears before paying.

Tip: Add a reminder for coupon expiry so you don’t miss it.

3) Money-Saving Playbook (Works Consistently)
Consolidate smartly
One outbound parcel often beats several small ones because you pay linehaul/handling once. If you’re buying multiple items, plan to ship together when feasible.

Reduce volume
Request lighter packaging where available, avoid unnecessary filler, and group small accessories. Lower L × W × H can reduce the charged (volumetric) weight.

Quality check before shipping
Approve photo/video QC (when offered) before consolidation to cut re-ship risk and extra costs.

Time your shipment
If your schedule is flexible, avoid peak dates. Ship right before or after big events when capacity and pricing are more favorable.

4) Choosing the Right Shipping Line
Economy: Lowest cost if you can wait longer.

Priority economy: A balanced option when you want quicker delivery without express pricing.

Express: Best for urgent, time-sensitive parcels.
Compare ETA, tracking level, and price for your destination before paying.

5) Regional Notes (What to Expect)
Popular routes: More frequent departures and competitive pricing.

Remote destinations: Plan extra time, compare lines carefully, and consider consolidation to keep costs predictable.

6) Customs & Import (Compliance First)
Know your local rules: Duties/taxes, documentation, and thresholds are set by your country.

Declare accurately: Follow legal requirements for descriptions and values.

Consider professional help: For complex shipments, a licensed customs broker can advise on documentation and process.

7) Tracking, Delivery & Support
Use both trackers: Check updates in your partner dashboard and on the carrier’s site.

Enable notifications: Get alerts for key milestones.

Delivery prep: Confirm address accuracy and ensure someone can receive the parcel.

If issues arise: Gather order IDs and screenshots, then contact official customer support channels.
