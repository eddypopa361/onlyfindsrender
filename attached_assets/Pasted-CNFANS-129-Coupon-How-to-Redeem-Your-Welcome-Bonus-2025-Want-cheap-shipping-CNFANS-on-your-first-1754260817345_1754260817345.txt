Open Coupons/Promotions
After login, go to Coupons (or Promotions) in your dashboard. Look for a $129 welcome coupon or other CNFANS discount code. If an activation button is shown, click it.

Check the terms
Review eligibility: expiry date, applicable shipping lines, any minimums, and your region.

Prepare your shipment
Add items to your warehouse/cart, choose a shipping line (economy / priority economy / express), and confirm the coupon applies at checkout before paying.

How to maximize the value
Consolidate when it makes sense
One outbound parcel often costs less than several small ones because you pay handling/linehaul once. (Results vary by line/zone.)

Reduce volumetric weight
Request lighter packaging where available, avoid excess filler, and group small accessories together so L×W×H stays compact.

Time it well
If your schedule is flexible, avoid peak rushes. Seasonal events can bring good promos but also higher demand—plan accordingly.

QC before shipping
Approve photo/video checks (when offered) to avoid re-ship costs.

Troubleshooting (quick fixes)
Coupon not showing?
Log out/in, refresh the page, and recheck Coupons/Promotions. If it still doesn’t appear, contact support via official channels.

Discount not applying at checkout?
Re-select the shipping line, ensure the coupon is eligible for that route, and confirm the total updates before you pay.

Expired or not eligible?
Look for alternate CNFANS shipping deals or seasonal offers in the dashboard and email notifications.
