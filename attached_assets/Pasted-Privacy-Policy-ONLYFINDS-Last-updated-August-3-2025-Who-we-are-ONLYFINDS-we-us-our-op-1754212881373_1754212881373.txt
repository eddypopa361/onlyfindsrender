Privacy Policy – ONLYFINDS
Last updated: August 3, 2025

Who we are
ONLYFINDS (“we”, “us”, “our”) operates a product discovery website. This policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and your choices.

What we collect

Usage data: pages viewed, clicks, approximate location (derived from IP), device/browser info, and referral source.

Account/contact info (optional): if you sign up for updates or contact us, we collect your email and any info you submit.

Cookies & similar: used for core functionality (e.g., session, preferences) and analytics/performance.

Payments & partners
We do not process or store payment information on ONLYFINDS. Some buttons and links (e.g., “Get $129 coupons”, “JOIN CNFANS NOW”) send you to partners such as CNFANS. When you follow those links, the partner may collect data under their own policy. Please review their privacy policy before purchasing.

Legal bases (EU/EEA)
We process data based on legitimate interests (site operation/analytics), consent (where required, e.g., optional cookies/newsletters), and contract (if you request services from us).

Sharing
We may share limited data with service providers (hosting, analytics) under contracts that require confidentiality and data protection. We also share referral information with partners when you click outbound links. We do not allow vendors to use your data for their own marketing.

Retention
We keep data only as long as needed for the purposes above or as required by law, then delete or anonymize it.

Your rights
Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict or object to processing, and data portability. You can also withdraw consent where processing is based on consent. To make a request, contact privacy@onlyfinds.com.

International transfers
If data is transferred outside your country, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses) where required.

Children
ONLYFINDS is not intended for children under 13 (or the age required by local law). We do not knowingly collect data from children.

Security
We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data; however, no system is 100% secure.

Third-party links
Our site contains links to third-party sites (e.g., CNFANS). Their practices are governed by their own policies.
