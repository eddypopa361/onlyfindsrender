How CNFANS coupons work (plain English)
Coupons reduce shipping cost (not product price).

Availability, eligibility, and line/region rules can change—always read the terms on the coupon card in your dashboard.

Usually one coupon per order; the system checks account status, order details, and shipping method eligibility at checkout.

Quick fixes (try these first)
Refresh + relogin: Log out/in, then reopen Coupons/Promotions.

Switch context: Try the CNFANS mobile app and desktop website; test another browser (Chrome/Firefox/Safari).

Clear clutter: Use a private/incognito window; temporarily disable ad-blockers.

Re-select line: Change the shipping line and reapply the coupon.

Confirm timing: High-traffic events can cause hiccups—wait a few minutes and retry.

Fix by error message
“Coupon code invalid” / “Code not found”
Remove extra spaces; type the code manually.

Check case, dashes, and character look-alikes (O/0, l/1).

Make sure the code is current for your region and line.

“Coupon not applicable to this order”
Verify the shipping line is eligible for that coupon.

Check for order minimums, weight/size thresholds, and regional limits.

Remove excluded items or try a different line.

“Minimum order value not met”
Review what counts toward the minimum; add a small item if needed.

Confirm currency settings and totals before shipping is added (if the terms specify).

“Coupon expired” / “No longer available”
Look for another CNFANS discount code in your dashboard or wait for the next promo window.

“Account not eligible”
Complete any email/phone/address verification.

Ensure you’re logged into the right account and that it meets the coupon’s conditions.

Device, browser & network checklist
Update your browser/app to the latest version.

Clear cache/cookies (or use a private window).

Disable extensions that may block scripts.

Try another network (mobile data vs Wi-Fi).

Restart the device if things still misbehave.

Account & payment sanity checks
Make sure your profile and shipping address are complete and formatted correctly.

Add a valid payment method supported in your region.

If totals display in another currency, recheck the coupon’s region/line rules.

When to contact support (and what to send)
Contact support if:

A coupon shown in your dashboard won’t apply after multiple attempts.

You completed verification and still see “not eligible.”

The discount appears and then disappears at payment.

Send with your message:

Screenshot of the coupon card and checkout page.

Your region, chosen shipping line, and approximate weight/size.

Browser/app version and the time of attempts.

Prevention: make coupons “just work”
Apply early: Use eligible coupons before they hit quantity or time limits.

Pick the right line: Read the coupon’s eligible shipping lines/regions.

Keep it tidy: One coupon per order; confirm the discount is visible before paying.

Plan around peaks: During 11.11/12.12/Black Friday, be ready with items, addresses, and payment methods.

FAQ
Where do I find current CNFANS coupons?

Can I stack multiple coupons?

Why did the discount vanish at payment?
Re-select the shipping line, reapply the coupon, and ensure terms still match your cart/region. If it persists, contact support with screenshots.
