## 1) Secure the Biggest Discounts First

**Register and claim welcome offers.** After you create an account, check the **Coupons/Promotions** section in your dashboard. Look for a **\$129 shipping coupon** or a seasonal promo tied to your shipping line.

**Watch seasonal windows.** Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Singles’ Day (11.11), 12.12, back‑to‑school, and mid‑year sales often include stronger shipping promos. If you can wait a few days, time your parcel for these periods.

**Use referrals when available.** Referral and affiliate campaigns sometimes add extra coupon value for new sign‑ups and first shipments.

## 2) Optimize What You Pay For (Weight, Volume, Shipping Line)

**Consolidate orders.** One outbound parcel is usually cheaper than several small ones because you pay handling and linehaul once.

**Lower volumetric weight.** Ask the warehouse to **remove shoe boxes** (if presentation isn’t critical) and **flatten apparel**. Reducing length/width/height can drop the charged weight significantly.

**Pick the right line.** Express is fast but expensive. Economy lines are cheaper; **priority economy** balances speed and price. Compare ETA and zones before paying.

**Avoid peak surcharges.** Pre‑holiday rushes often add temporary fees. If your items are not urgent, ship right after the rush.

**Prevent reship with QC.** Approve photo/video **quality checks** before consolidation. Avoiding a return/reship protects your savings.

> **Compliance note:** Always declare items accurately and follow your local customs rules.

## 3) How to Use CNFANS Promo Codes Effectively

1. **Check the dashboard first.** Apply the highest‑value **eligible** coupon for your chosen shipping line.
2. **Assume one code per order.** Most coupons don’t stack. Weigh a fixed amount (e.g., \$129) against a percentage discount to see which wins for your parcel.
3. **Match the rules.** Some codes require minimum weight/value or specific lines. Read the terms to avoid losing eligibility.
4. **Mind the expiry.** If you’re still waiting for items to arrive, set a reminder so you can consolidate and ship **before** the code expires.

## 4) Example: Separate vs. Consolidated

**Scenario:** 3 apparel items + 1 pair of sneakers.

* **Separate parcels (4 shipments):** pay handling & linehaul four times; the shoebox increases volumetric weight.
* **Consolidated (1 shipment):** a single handling fee; shoebox removed; apparel vacuum‑packed → **lower volume** and **one coupon** applied once. Net savings are typically higher.

> Many buyers see a **20–40%** lower effective per‑item shipping cost with consolidation (varies by line/zone).

## 5) Packaging Choices That Lower Cost

* **Remove shoebox** when you don’t need retail presentation.
* **Vacuum‑pack apparel** (confirm availability) to reduce thickness.
* **Group small accessories** into one pouch.
* **Don’t over‑stuff.** Moving up one size class can erase the discount.

## 6) Plan With a Simple Spreadsheet

Track item **weight**, **L/W/H**, **arrival date**, **QC status**, **box removal**, and a **target ship date**. Ship on a coupon day with enough items to hit the best price tier—without pushing volume too high.
