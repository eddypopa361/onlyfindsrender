## Understanding CNFANS Shipping Cost Structure

### Base Shipping Rates and Calculations

CNFANS shipping costs are calculated using a combination of factors that determine your final price:

**Weight-Based Pricing**: Most shipping lines charge by actual or volumetric weight, whichever is higher. Understanding this helps you optimize packaging and consolidation.

**Destination Zones**: Shipping costs vary significantly based on your location. Major cities and regions with better logistics infrastructure typically enjoy lower rates.

**Shipping Line Selection**: Different carriers offer varying price points and service levels. Economy options sacrifice speed for cost savings, while express services prioritize delivery time.

**Seasonal Fluctuations**: Shipping rates change throughout the year based on demand, with peak seasons (holidays, festivals) commanding premium pricing.

### Hidden Costs and Fee Structure

**Handling and Processing Fees**: CNFANS charges service fees for package processing, quality inspection, and customer service support.

**Storage Costs**: Extended warehouse storage beyond free periods incurs daily charges that can accumulate quickly.

**Special Service Fees**: Photo requests, custom packaging, removal of branded materials, and other services carry additional charges.

**Insurance and Liability**: Optional insurance protects against loss or damage but adds to overall shipping costs.
